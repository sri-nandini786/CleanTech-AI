# CleanTech-AI

## AI-Powered Waste Classification System

CleanTech is an intelligent waste classification system powered by Artificial Intelligence. By employing advanced transfer learning techniques, it classifies waste into categories such as **Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash** with high precision.

The project aims to **reduce human error**, **support recycling efforts**, and **promote sustainable waste management practices** across the globe.

## Features

- **Image Upload and Classification**: Upload waste images and get instant classification results with confidence scores.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 model fine-tuned for waste classification.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design built with Bootstrap and Flask.
- **Multiple Pages**: Includes About, Uses, Integration, Impact, How It Works, and Contact sections.
- **Flash Messages**: Provides user feedback for form submissions.
- **Secure File Handling**: Supports image uploads with validation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veera5423/CleanTech-AI.git
   cd CleanTech-AI
   ```

2. Run the setup script to install all prerequisites and set up the environment:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all required dependencies
   - Verify presence of model and config files

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
If you prefer manual installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veera5423/CleanTech-AI.git
   cd CleanTech-AI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask tensorflow keras numpy pillow
   ```

3. Ensure the model file `waste_classifier.h5` and `class_indices.json` are in the root directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Upload an image of waste using the upload form on the home page.

4. View the classification result, including the predicted category and confidence percentage.
